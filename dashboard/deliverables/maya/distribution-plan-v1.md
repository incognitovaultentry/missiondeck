## 1. Channel Priority List — Ranked by Speed-to-Conversion

| Rank | Channel | Rationale | Est. Time to First Sale |
|------|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 | **r/LifetimeDeals** | Audience is actively hunting LTDs right now. High purchase intent. A good post can drive 5–10 sales in 48 hours. | 24–48 hrs |
| 2 | **AppSumo (submission)** | Massive deal-hunter audience; submission takes time but if accepted = 50+ sales. Start NOW so it queues. | 2–6 weeks (async) |
| 3 | **Indie Hackers** | Bootstrapper/SaaS-builder audience loves supporting fellow founders. Great for product-story posts. Converts well in 3–7 days. | 3–7 days |
| 4 | **Twitter @sitepinscms** | Owned channel. Zero friction to post. Compounds over time. Start the scarcity clock publicly. | 2–5 days |
| 5 | **r/webdev** | 1.8M devs who build exactly the sites Sitepins targets. Angle: "solved this for clients." | 3–7 days |
| 6 | **r/SideProject** | Good for founder-story angle. Lower purchase intent than r/LifetimeDeals but good for brand. | 5–10 days |
| 7 | **r/nextjs / r/astro / r/hugo** | Niche communities with perfect ICP fit. Low noise, high relevance. | 5–14 days |
| 8 | **Product Hunt** | Launch spike visibility. Plan for Day 14–21 if possible. Requires preparation. | 7–14 days (post-launch) |
| 9 | **Dev Discord/Slack communities** | Jamstack Discord, Hugo forums, etc. Authentic, but slower burn. | 7–21 days |
| 10 | **Cold outreach (freelance devs on Twitter)** | DM freelancers who tweet about Astro/Hugo/Next.js client work. Personal, converts well but labor-intensive. | 7–21 days |

**Tier 1 priority rationale:** r/LifetimeDeals + AppSumo submission + IH + Twitter cover the broadest high-intent audience fastest. The remaining 5 sold fast with zero external push — external channels will accelerate this.

## 2. Ready-to-Post Content

### 2a. r/LifetimeDeals — Full Post

**Title:**
```
[DEAL] Sitepins – Git-based Headless CMS for Static Sites | $199/$249 One-Time | 95 of 100 Lifetime Seats Left
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/LifetimeDeals 👋

I want to share a deal on a tool I've been watching: **Sitepins** — a Git-backed headless CMS that lets non-technical people edit content on Astro, Next.js, and Hugo sites without touching code.

**Why it's different from other CMS tools:**
- Everything is Git-first — every edit is versioned, trackable, and reversible
- Clients/teammates get a visual editor; devs keep full code control
- Works with Markdown, JSON, YAML, TOML — whatever your static site uses
- Built-in AI assistant (bring your own OpenAI key)
- 650+ users already using it in production

---

**The Lifetime Deal:**

| Plan | LTD Price | vs. Monthly |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Pro | **$199 one-time** | $12/mo → pays back in 17 months |
| Team | **$249 one-time** | $49/mo → pays back in **6 months** ✅ |
| Enterprise | $4,999 one-time | Custom → pays back fast for agencies |

Team plan is the sweet spot IMO — 15 sites, 5 orgs, 5 users per org, GitHub + GitLab. For freelancers with multiple clients this basically pays for itself by Q3.

**Only 100 lifetime seats total. 95 left.** Not "unlimited forever" — actual scarcity.

---

**Who this is for:**
- Freelance devs who build Astro/Hugo/Next.js sites for clients
- Small agencies whose clients need to update content without emailing you every time
- Anyone running a JAMstack site who needs a proper CMS without the Contentful/Sanity price tag

### 2b. r/SideProject — Full Post

**Title:**
```
I built a Git-based headless CMS for Astro/Hugo/Next.js sites — now offering 100 lifetime seats to early supporters
```

**Body:**
```
Hey r/SideProject 👋

I've been following the headless CMS space for a while, and there's a recurring frustration in the dev community: you spend hours building a clean static site, and then your client or marketing team needs to update the content — and suddenly you're the CMS.

**Sitepins** was built to solve exactly that.

It's a Git-based headless CMS that:
- Gives non-technical editors a visual UI to update text, images, and content
- Keeps everything in Git — versioned, reversible, tracked
- Works with Astro, Next.js, Hugo, and other static site generators
- Supports Markdown, JSON, YAML, TOML
- Has an AI assistant for content generation (bring your OpenAI key)
- Handles roles, permissions, and multi-org setups

650+ developers are already using it. We just launched a **lifetime deal** to fund continued development — 100 seats total, 95 left.

**Pricing:**
- Pro LTD: **$199 one-time** (vs $12/mo)
- Team LTD: **$249 one-time** (vs $49/mo — pays back in 6 months)

If you've ever wished your clients could update their own site without pinging you, this is the tool.

Open to feedback, questions, and roasts. 🙏

### 2c. Indie Hackers — Full Post

**Title:**
```
We have 650+ free users and just launched a lifetime deal to fund our path to $10k MRR — here's what we've learned so far
```

**Body:**
```
Hey IH community 👋

We've been building **Sitepins** quietly for a while — a Git-based headless CMS for static sites (Astro, Next.js, Hugo).

The idea came from a very common pain point: developers build great static sites, but the moment a non-technical client or teammate needs to update content, the dev becomes an accidental content manager. We wanted to fix that.

**Where we are now:**
- 650+ registered users
- Positive early feedback from freelancers and small agencies
- Bootstrapped, no VC funding
- Revenue goal: $10k MRR

**Why the lifetime deal approach:**
We're not doing this because we're desperate — we're doing it because we want early believers to get a great deal, and we want the feedback from paying customers to shape our roadmap faster than free users tend to do.

We capped it at **100 seats total** because we want to stay accountable to this cohort and not over-sell something we haven't fully validated at scale.

**Pricing:**
- Pro LTD: $199 (vs $12/mo)
- Team LTD: $249 (vs $49/mo → ROI in ~6 months)
- Enterprise LTD: $4,999 (agencies with unlimited sites/users)

**What's working:**
- SEO-optimized product page driving organic signups
- Clear "here's who this is for" messaging (freelancers + small agencies)
- Real testimonials from devs who use it in production

**What we're figuring out:**
- Community distribution — Reddit, IH, Twitter. Learning what resonates with what audience.
- Conversion from free → paid (improving docs and onboarding)
- Getting the word out without spamming

If you're building Astro/Next.js/Hugo sites for clients and need a CMS that clients can actually use, we'd love your feedback — and if you want to support us, the lifetime deal is here:

Happy to answer anything in the comments — about the product, the LTD approach, the stack, whatever.

What's been your experience with CMS tools for client projects? Curious what you've tried.

### 2d. Twitter @sitepinscms — 3-Tweet Thread

**Tweet 1 (Hook + announcement):**
```
We just opened 100 Lifetime Deal seats for Sitepins.

Git-based headless CMS. One-time payment. No recurring fees. Ever.

Pro: $199 | Team: $249 | Enterprise: $4,999

95 seats left. Here's why we built it 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem + product story):**
```
Every developer who builds static sites knows this pain:

You finish the site. Client loves it.
Two weeks later: "Can you change the homepage headline?"
Next week: "Can you update that blog post?"
Month two: You're their content manager.

Sitepins fixes this.

Non-technical editors get a visual editor. You keep Git control. Every edit is versioned, reversible, and tracked.

Works with Astro, Next.js, Hugo, and more.
650+ devs are already using it.
```

**Tweet 3 (CTA + scarcity):**
```
If you build sites for clients, this pays for itself fast.

Team LTD at $249 vs $49/mo → ROI in 6 months.

Only 100 seats ever. 95 left right now.

| Day 10 | Tweet: "10 seats sold 🎉" update (if true) | Twitter | Social proof + countdown. Even 8 or 9 seats is worth sharing. |

If there's no analytics on the site yet — set it up before Day 1. Every click without tracking is lost signal.
