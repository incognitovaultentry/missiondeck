**Audience:** All 700 free users  
**Suggested send time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 9:00 AM in your primary user timezone (US/EU)

**Subject A (primary):**  
`We're running a lifetime deal. 100 seats. No renewals, ever.`

**Subject B (A/B variant):**  
`Sitepins forever — one payment, done.`

**Preview text:**  
`95 seats available. Pro at $199 or Team at $249 — once.`

**Email body:**

Hey,

You signed up for Sitepins because you needed a better way to let clients or teammates edit content on your sites — without touching code, without breaking things.

We appreciate that. You've been using the free plan, and now we want to give you a reason to stick around forever.

**We're running a lifetime deal. 100 seats. No subscription. No renewals.**

Here's what's on the table:

**Pro Lifetime — $199 (one-time)**  
Up to 6 sites · 2 orgs · 3 users · AI assistant · all Pro features  
Regular price: $12/month. This pays for itself in under 2 years — then it's free, forever.

**Team Lifetime — $249 (one-time)**  
Up to 15 sites · 5 orgs · 5 users · GitLab support · all Team features  
Regular price: $49/month ($588/year). At $249, it pays back in **6 months**.

That's the whole pitch. One payment. Use Sitepins for as long as you want.

5 teams already grabbed their seats over the weekend. 95 remain.

This isn't a rolling offer. When 100 seats are gone, that's it — pricing goes back to monthly.

# EMAIL 2 — Midpoint Nudge

**Trigger:** When ~50 seats have been sold (approximately Day 5–7)  
**Audience:** Non-openers of Email 1 + all users who haven't purchased  
**Suggested send time:** Same weekday formula — Tuesday or Wednesday, 9:00 AM; or Thursday if mid-week launch  

---

**Subject A (primary):**  
`50 seats gone. 50 left. (Sitepins lifetime deal)`

**Subject B (A/B variant):**  
`Halfway through our lifetime deal — still a spot for you`

**Preview text:**  
`We're at the halfway mark. Here's where things stand.`

**CTA button text:** `Lock in your seat →`

**Email body:**

Hey,

Quick update on the Sitepins lifetime deal:

**50 of 100 seats are gone.**

That happened faster than we expected. We launched 5 days ago and we're already at the halfway point.

50 seats remain. Here's what's still available:

**Pro Lifetime — $199 one-time**  
6 sites · 3 users · AI assistant · all Pro features  
(vs $12/month ongoing)

**Team Lifetime — $249 one-time**  
15 sites · 5 users · GitLab support · all Team features  
(vs $49/month — pays back in 6 months, then zero forever)

If you've been meaning to upgrade and kept putting it off, this is the moment to decide.

Once the 100 seats are gone, the deal closes. No exceptions, no extensions. The seat counter on the pricing page updates live.

# EMAIL 3 — Final Urgency

**Trigger:** When ~10 seats remain  
**Audience:** All users who have NOT purchased (buyers excluded)  
**Suggested send time:** Send as soon as the 10-seat threshold is hit — don't wait for a "good" send time; urgency is the moment  

---

**Subject A (primary):**  
`10 seats left. Then the lifetime deal is gone.`

**Subject B (A/B variant):**  
`Last call: Sitepins LTD closes when seat 100 goes`

**Preview text:**  
`We're at 90/100. 10 seats left. No restock, no extension.`

---

**CTA button text:** `Get one of the last seats →`

---

**Email body:**

---

Hey,

We're down to 10 seats.

90 people have already locked in Sitepins for life. When the last 10 are gone, the deal closes and pricing goes back to monthly — permanently.

This is the last email you'll get about this.

**What's still available (while it lasts):**

**Pro Lifetime — $199**  
One payment. All Pro features, forever.

**Team Lifetime — $249**  
One payment. All Team features, forever.  
If you're on a team or building for clients: $49/month adds up to $588 a year. At $249, you break even in 6 months — then every month after that is free.

No tricks. The seat counter on the pricing page is live and accurate.

## Notes for Alex / Tony

**Segment hygiene:**
- Email 2: exclude anyone who purchased after Email 1; suppress bounces and unsubscribes
- Email 3: same — exclude all confirmed buyers, send only to remaining non-purchasers

**Brevo setup reminders:**
- Create a dedicated campaign for each email; don't reuse the same campaign
- Use the "exclude list" feature to suppress buyers (pull from dashboard before each send)
- UTM tags suggested: `?utm_source=email&utm_campaign=ltd2026&utm_content=email1` (change number per email)

**Subject line testing:**
- Split A/B at 20% each, wait 4 hours, send winner to remaining 60%
- Track: open rate, click rate, revenue per email

**Success benchmarks (rough):**
- Email 1: 30–40% open rate, 5–10% CTR, 5–10 purchases
- Email 2: 20–30% open rate among non-openers, 3–7 purchases
- Email 3: 15–25% open rate, highest urgency conversion — aim for 5–8 final purchases

**Reply handling:**
- Pre-write a short FAQ reply for: "Can I upgrade later?", "Is this really limited?", "Do you support [framework]?"
- Tony should be available to reply personally during the 3-day window after Email 3 drops
