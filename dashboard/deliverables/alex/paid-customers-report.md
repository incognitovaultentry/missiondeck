| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| **Full name** | Jan Bartkowiak |
| **Email** | jan.bartkowiak@pragtics.de |
| **User ID** | @user_jan_bartkowiak_pragtics_de |
| **Country** | Germany |

**About the company:** Pragtics GmbH is a German digital transformation firm founded in 2018. They work with businesses across organisational, process, and technology transformations — hands-on implementation, not just strategy. "Not just strategy consultants, we are strategy executors." They work across multiple clients meaning multiple sites, workflows, and mixed dev/non-dev teams — a textbook Sitepins buyer. **Jan is also the earliest real customer** (purchased September 2025). He also has a custom profile photo uploaded, suggesting meaningful engagement with the platform.

A colleague, Sarah Porep (sarah.porep@pragtics.de), also signed up on 2025-10-07 but has not yet converted — a warm lead inside the same company.

### 4. Daniel White 🇬🇧
| Field | Data |
|-------|------|
| **Full name** | Daniel White |
| **Email** | daniel.white.1990@outlook.com |
| **User ID** | @user_daniel_white_1990_outlook_com |
| **Country** | United Kingdom |
| **Sign-up date** | 2025-10-21 09:24 UTC |
| **Profile** | GitHub-linked account (avatar from GitHub: github.com/u/39915806) |

**About this user:** Daniel is the only customer without a business email — using a personal Outlook address, likely a freelance developer or indie hacker. His GitHub-linked profile confirms he's a developer. He's from the UK, which may explain his payment amount ($296.40 vs the standard $249 — consistent with £249 GBP converted to USD at ~0.84 exchange rate). He is also the **fastest converter** — signed up and bought within the same minute (09:24 sign-up, 09:25 order), suggesting he came in pre-sold, possibly via a referral, social post, or link directly to the pricing page.

### 5. Colin Neller — Netcosa 🇺🇸

## 2. Plan Breakdown

| Customer | Package | Status | Payment | Order ID |
|----------|---------|--------|---------|----------|
| Scott Owens | **Team LTD** | ✅ Active | $249.00 | txn_01kbhdxt6ey7wwyngq91hevhwh |
| Max Dennis | **Team LTD** | ✅ Active | $249.00 | txn_01kccbg39yw6rxs5fnj3cyvt3t |
| Jan Bartkowiak | **Team LTD** | ✅ Active | $247.00 | txn_01k5m438w2afcap4rbyn106axc |
| Daniel White | **Team LTD** | ✅ Active | $296.40 | txn_01k831ankwtnvw265j99sag3hy |
| Colin Neller | **Team LTD** | ✅ Active | $273.28 | txn_01kfhadb41pem7xbkrdvw1h7nk |

**Key insight: Every single paying customer chose Team LTD. Zero Pro LTD sales.**

Team LTD ($249) vs Pro LTD ($199): The extra $50 gets you 15 sites (vs 6), 5 orgs (vs 2), 5 users (vs 3), and GitLab support. For anyone managing multiple client sites, this is an obvious choice.

## 3. Sign-up vs Purchase Timeline

| Customer | Signed Up | Purchased | Time to Convert |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Jan Bartkowiak | Sep 13, 2025 | Sep 20, 2025 | **7 days** |
| Daniel White | Oct 21, 2025 09:24 | Oct 21, 2025 09:25 | **~1 minute** ⚡ |
| Scott Owens | Dec 1, 2025 | Dec 3, 2025 | **2 days** |
| Max Dennis | Dec 11, 2025 | Dec 13, 2025 | **2 days** |
| Colin Neller | Jan 15, 2026 | Jan 21, 2026 | **6 days** |

**Median conversion time: 2 days.**  
**Average conversion time: ~3.4 days** (excluding the 1-minute outlier, average is ~4.3 days)

### What this tells us:
- These are **fast, intentional buyers** — not casual browsers. They try it, see the value, and buy quickly.
- Daniel White's 1-minute conversion is particularly notable — he arrived at Sitepins already wanting to buy. He was likely sent directly to the pricing page via a referral, social share, or external article.
- The 7-day window for Jan (September) and 6-day window for Colin (January) are the longer delays — possibly they needed to evaluate the product or get internal sign-off.
- No one took weeks or months to decide. This is a low-friction, trust-your-gut purchase.

### Sale acquisition over time:
```
Sep 2025 │ ● Jan Bartkowiak (Pragtics, DE)
Oct 2025 │ ● Daniel White (UK freelancer)
Nov 2025 │ —
Dec 2025 │ ● Scott Owens (Arlula, AU)
         │ ● Max Dennis (Conversion Collective, CA)
Jan 2026 │ ● Colin Neller (Netcosa, US)
```
Sales have been consistent but slow — roughly 1/month. The campaign needs velocity.

## 4. Patterns Across the 5 Customers

### 🌍 Geography
- Australia, Canada, Germany, UK, United States
- All from English-speaking or English-comfortable tech markets
- **No customer from a developing market** — pricing ($249 one-time) self-selects for established markets
- Genuinely global from day one — no single dominant market

### 🏢 Company type
| Customer | Type |
|----------|------|
| Arlula | SaaS product company (developer-led) |
| Conversion Collective | Performance marketing agency (client-facing) |
| Pragtics GmbH | Digital transformation consultancy (client-facing) |
| Daniel White | Freelance developer / indie |
| Netcosa | Managed Service Provider / IT consultancy (client-facing) |

**3 out of 5 are service firms managing multiple clients.** This is a strong signal — the Team plan's value proposition (multiple sites, multiple orgs) is most compelling for agencies and consultancies.

### 💼 Industry spread
- Geospatial / satellite tech
- Performance marketing / advertising
- Digital transformation / consulting
- Independent development / indie hacking
- Healthcare IT / MSP

No clustering around a single vertical — but **the shared thread is: they all build and manage web content for clients or multiple internal stakeholders**. The common pain point isn't the industry — it's the multi-site, multi-client workflow.

### 💰 Plan preference
**100% Team LTD.** This is striking and unambiguous. Despite the Pro LTD being cheaper ($199 vs $249), no one chose it. Possible reasons:
1. The Team plan's limits (15 sites, 5 users) fit the actual use case better
2. The $50 difference is insignificant relative to the value
3. GitLab support (Team only) matters to some users
4. People buying for a team/agency always want headroom

### 🔗 Profile characteristics
- 4/5 signed in via Google OAuth (Max, Jessie at CC, Jan has photo, Colin has Google pic)
- 1/5 via GitHub (Daniel White)
- No one created plain username/password accounts — these are tech-comfortable SaaS users

## 5. ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) for the LTD Campaign

Based on the 5 paying customers, here is a sharpened ICP for Sitepins' LTD campaign:

### Primary ICP: The Multi-Site Agency/Consultancy
**Who they are:**
> A small-to-mid digital agency, performance marketing firm, or technical consultancy that builds and maintains 3–15+ websites for clients. They have a small dev team (2–5 people) who build the sites, plus non-technical account managers or client editors who need to update content without touching code. They already use modern stacks (Astro, Next.js, Hugo) and care about git-based workflows.

**Signals:**
- Company domain email (not gmail/outlook)
- Service/agency business model (not a single-product company)
- Team size: 5–50 people
- Role: CTO, Lead Dev, Technical Founder, Head of Engineering

**Why they buy Team LTD:**
- They manage multiple client sites and need multi-org support
- Recurring CMS costs eat into margins — a one-time fee is very attractive
- The $249 Team payback math is compelling: vs. $49/mo × 12 = $588/yr → ROI in ~5 months

### Secondary ICP: The Technical Freelancer / Indie Developer
**Who they are:**
> A solo developer or indie hacker who builds sites for multiple clients or personal projects. They care about tooling quality, hate vendor lock-in, and appreciate paying once and being done. They arrived at Sitepins via dev community channels (GitHub, Twitter/X, dev blogs).

**Signals:**
- Personal email or indie company domain
- GitHub-linked account
- Fast conversion (came in pre-sold, likely from word-of-mouth or community post)

**Channels to reach them:** GitHub trending, Hacker News, dev.to, Twitter/X #buildinpublic

### Tertiary ICP: The Technical MSP / IT Services Firm
**Who they are:**
> An IT services company or MSP that manages digital infrastructure for multiple business clients. They're adding CMS to their service stack and want predictable tooling costs with no monthly surprises — fits well with their own fixed-pricing MSP model.

**Why Sitepins resonates:** "No recurring fees" maps directly to their own predictable-pricing value proposition.

## 6. Strategic Observations & Recommendations

### 🎯 De-emphasise Pro LTD in outreach
Zero conversions on Pro LTD. When writing emails, lead with Team LTD as the primary offer. Pro LTD can be a fallback mention ("or the Pro plan at $199 if you're solo"), but the hero offer should be Team.

### 📣 Agency-forward messaging
Reframe copy for agencies and consultancies explicitly:
> "If you're managing more than 3 client sites, the Team LTD pays for itself before your next quarterly review."

### ⚡ Pre-sold buyers exist — make the path frictionless
Daniel White converted in 1 minute. He arrived knowing what he wanted. Make sure the pricing page → checkout is frictionless, and that external links (from social posts, product hunts, blog mentions) land directly on the pricing page or a dedicated LTD landing page.

### 🌍 English-speaking markets first, then DACH
4/5 buyers are AU/CA/UK/US. Germany (Jan at Pragtics) is the outlier and a positive signal — the German-speaking market (DACH) is full of agencies and consultancies. Consider a dedicated DACH email or at minimum German-language social amplification.

### 👥 Warm leads in existing accounts
Sarah Porep (sarah.porep@pragtics.de) — colleague of Jan Bartkowiak — is already signed up but hasn't converted. She's a warm lead at a company that is already a paying customer. Targeting existing-company colleagues is a low-effort, high-probability conversion.

### 🧮 "5 teams already grabbed their seats" — social proof is available
The CONTEXT.md says "use this as social proof." With the company detail now available, you can go further:
> "Teams at agencies and consultancies in Australia, Canada, Germany, the UK, and the US have already locked in their seats."
